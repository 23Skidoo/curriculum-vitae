    \section{\sc Work Experience}

     {\bf \href{https://helloprima.co.uk}{Prima UK}} \hfill {\it 2020-now, Back-end Developer}\\
    Working on data source integration and pricing for Prima's car insurance products.\\
    \begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1.5em}
        \item Contributed to the development of the pricing engine for a major product launch.
        \item Integrated third-party data sources to enhance risk assessment capabilities.
        \item Designed and implemented observability and monitoring solutions for the insurance platform.
        \item Built data pipelines for processing and analysing large-scale datasets.
        \item Maintained and improved the codebase, ensuring high standards of code quality and performance.
    \end{list}
    Technology stack: Rust, Elixir, TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, AWS, Kubernetes.

        {\bf \href{https://scrive.com}{Scrive AB}} \hfill {\it 2016-2020, Back-end Developer}\\
    Developing and maintaining the Scrive e-signing platform, Scrive eID
    Hub, and associated projects.

        {\bf \href{https://haskell.org}{Haskell.org}} \hfill {\it Summer 2013, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
    Worked on adding support for module-level parallel builds to
    \href{https://haskell.org/cabal}{Cabal}, a system for building and
    packaging Haskell libraries and programs.

        {\bf \href{https://haskell.org}{Haskell.org}} \hfill {\it Summer 2012, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
    Added support for sandboxed builds and isolated environments to
    Cabal. Sandboxing partially solves the important ``Cabal hell'' problem. Code
    ships with Cabal since version 1.18.

        {\bf \href{https://haskell.org}{Haskell.org}} \hfill {\it Summer 2011, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
    Parallelised the standard \texttt{cabal-install} tool, making it possible to
    build multiple Cabal packages in parallel. Code ships with Cabal since version
    1.16.

        {\bf Codedgers Inc.} \hfill {\it 2007-2011, Software Engineer}\\
    Worked on \href{https://archive.is/ZAI8z}{Morpher}, an LLVM-based code
    obfuscator. Wrote a generic compiler driver
    (\href{https://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/CompilerDriver.html}{\texttt{llvmc}}). Implemented
    a dynamic software watermarking tool suite.

    \section{\sc Education}

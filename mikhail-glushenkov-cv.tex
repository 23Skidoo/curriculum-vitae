\section{\sc Work Experience}

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2013, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
(Work in progress.) I'm adding support for module-level parallel builds to
Cabal, a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs.

% My code is integrated into the development version of Cabal.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2012, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Added support for sandboxed builds and isolated environments to
Cabal. Sandboxing partially solves the important ``Cabal hell'' problem. Code
ships with Cabal since version 1.18.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2011, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Parallelised the standard \texttt{cabal-install} tool, making it possible to
build multiple Cabal packages in parallel. Code ships with Cabal since version
1.16.

{\bf Codedgers Inc.} \hfill {\it December 2007-May 2011, Software Engineer}\\
Worked on Morpher (\url{http://morpher.com/}), an LLVM-based code
obfuscator. Wrote a generic compiler driver (\texttt{llvmc}). Implemented a
dynamic software watermarking tool suite.

% {\bf Goha.ru} \hfill {\it 2006-2007, Newswriter and Community Manager}\\
% Responsibilities included journalistic work and management of one of the biggest
% Russian MMORPG communities.

% {\bf Misc. freelance work} \hfill {\it 2005-2007}\\
% Included writing a GUI forum client in wxPython and some simple OpenGL apps in
% C++.

\section{\sc Education}
{\bf Umeå University}, Umeå, Sweden\\
MSc(Eng) in Computer Science, May 2014 (expected)

{\bf Technical University of Denmark}, Copenhagen, Denmark\\
Types at Work Summer School (\url{http://typesatwork.imm.dtu.dk/}), August 2009

\section{\sc Portfolio}

{\bf ghc-parmake}, 2011-now \hfill \url{https://github.com/23Skidoo/ghc-parmake}\\
A parallel driver for the GHC Haskell Compiler. It can build a Haskell
program in parallel using multiple cores (à la \texttt{make -j}). Used as a
drop-in replacement for \texttt{ghc --make}.

{\bf Haskell Platform}, 2009-now \hfill \url{http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/}\\
The Haskell Platform is a single, standard Haskell distribution for every
system, in the form of a blessed library and tool suite for Haskell. I maintain
the Windows installer.

% http://goo.gl/67nKm
{\bf llvmc}, 2007-2011 \hfill \url{http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/CompilerDriver.html}\\
A generic compiler driver, designed to be customisable and extensible. Generates
a C++ driver program from a declarative description. Used to be a part of the
LLVM project.

% {\bf brabantio}, 2012 \hfill \url{https://github.com/23Skidoo/brabantio}\\
% An implementation of Othello (reversi) in Ocaml. Uses alpha-beta pruning for
% game tree search.

{\bf Open source}\\ I worked on patches for various open source projects
including Doxygen, LLVM, GHC and Cabal. I'm
\href{https://github.com/23Skidoo/}{\texttt{23Skidoo}} on GitHub.

{\bf Blog}, 2011-now \hfill \url{http://coldwa.st/e/blog}

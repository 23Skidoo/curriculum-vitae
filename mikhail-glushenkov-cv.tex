\section{\sc Work Experience}

{\bf Umeå University} \hfill {\it Sep. 2015-Mar. 2016, freelance contractor}\\
Performing maintenance on \href{https://github.com/genomizer}{Genomizer}, a web
application used by \href{http://www.epicon.nu}{researchers in molecular biology}.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2013, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Added support for module-level parallel builds to
\href{http://haskell.org/cabal}{Cabal}, a system for building and packaging
Haskell libraries and programs. Code partially integrated into the development
version of Cabal.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2012, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Added support for sandboxed builds and isolated environments to
Cabal. Sandboxing partially solves the important ``Cabal hell'' problem. Code
ships with Cabal since version 1.18.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2011, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Parallelised the standard \texttt{cabal-install} tool, making it possible to
build multiple Cabal packages in parallel. Code ships with Cabal since version
1.16.

{\bf Codedgers Inc.} \hfill {\it December 2007-May 2011, Software Engineer}\\
Worked on Morpher (\url{http://morpher.com/}), an LLVM-based code
obfuscator. Wrote a generic compiler driver
(\href{http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/CompilerDriver.html}{\texttt{llvmc}}). Implemented
a dynamic software watermarking tool suite.

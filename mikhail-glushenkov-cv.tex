\section{\sc Work Experience}

{\bf \href{http://prima.it}{Prima UK}} \hfill {\it 2020-now, Back-end Developer}\\
Working on data source integration and pricing for Prima's car
insurance product in preparation for the UK launch (technology stack:
Elixir, TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS).

{\bf \href{http://scrive.com}{Scrive AB}} \hfill {\it 2016-2020, Back-end Developer}\\
Developing and maintaining the Scrive e-signing platform, Scrive eID
Hub, and associated projects (technology stack: GHC/Haskell,
Happstack, Servant, Elm, PostgreSQL, AWS).

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2013, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Worked on adding support for module-level parallel builds to
\href{http://haskell.org/cabal}{Cabal}, a system for building and
packaging Haskell libraries and programs.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2012, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Added support for sandboxed builds and isolated environments to
Cabal. Sandboxing partially solves the important ``Cabal hell'' problem. Code
ships with Cabal since version 1.18.

{\bf Haskell.org} \hfill {\it Summer 2011, Google Summer of Code Student}\\
Parallelised the standard \texttt{cabal-install} tool, making it possible to
build multiple Cabal packages in parallel. Code ships with Cabal since version
1.16.

{\bf Codedgers Inc.} \hfill {\it 2007-2011, Software Engineer}\\
Worked on Morpher (\url{http://archive.is/ZAI8z}), an LLVM-based code
obfuscator. Wrote a generic compiler driver
(\href{http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/CompilerDriver.html}{\texttt{llvmc}}). Implemented
a dynamic software watermarking tool suite.

\section{\sc Education}
{\bf Umeå University}, Umeå, Sweden\\
BSc Eng in Computer Science, June 2016.

\section{\sc Open Source}

{\bf Haskell Cabal}, 2011-2020 \hfill \url{https://github.com/haskell/cabal/}\\

this involved mentoring GSoC students, reviewing pull requests,
providing advice to new contributors, steering the discussion, and
determining the overall direction of the project.

Contributed to various open source projects including Haskell
Platform, LLVM, \texttt{ekg}, and others. I'm
